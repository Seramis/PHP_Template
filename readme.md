# PHP Template #
PHP itself is a powerful language... and very powerful for templating too! Why to start to reinvent the wheel, when you could just use PHP by itself as a templating language? Besides, you already know PHP, so why should I say to you that now you need to learn new language?
This templating class makes it a bit easier to write [alternative php syntax](http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.alternative-syntax.php) into templates.

## Example template ##
```php
{/* This is a comment. */}
Hello, {=$name}!<br />
{for($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++):}
	Iteration {=$i}<br />
{endfor;}
{Tpl::incl('%path%/relative/path/to/template.tpl'}
```

## So what does it do? ##
Basically only thing it does, is replacing `{blah}` to `<?blah?>`. There's also a rule, that **if there is any whitespace or line ending right after opening bracket, it will be not parsed.** This way you can write JS code into templates and templating engine will not screw it up.

It also provides some keywords for your template:

* `%tpl%` - template path and filename (Ex: tpl/main.tpl)
* `%path%` - template's path (Ex: tpl)
* `%file%` - template's file name (Ex: main.tpl)

And for last, you have `$this` available, that directs to current template's PHP object.

Templates are compiled into PHP files, so it can take advantage of every kind of PHP accelerator for speed.
Eventually, what you will see on screen, will be generated by native PHP code. Compiling is quick and simple and after the file is compiled, it just executes compiled, native PHP code.

## I want to add some function to use in class ##
Just create function in php, and use it. Lets make a function and put it in our index file for example:
```php
function make_safe($sString)
{
	return htmlentities($sString);
}
```
And now, in templates:
```php
{=$sBadString} {/* This is the bad way */}
{=make_safe($sBadString)} {/* This is now safe */}
```
Like said before, it really is just php by itself.
